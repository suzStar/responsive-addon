                    <h3>WHY LISBON?</h3>
                    <h2>Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h2>
                    <p>The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, for its resemblance to the Roman
                        capital.
                        Just like
                        Rome, Lisbon began its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills. However, it wasn't
                        until
                        the
                        17th century,
                        in the writing of Frey Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete
                        colinas'
                        -
                        the
                        city of seven
                        hills. You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array of shops with
                        international
                        brands, peaceful
                        streetside cafes selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with a variety of
                        global
                        cuisine, you can
                        still wander the seven hills and see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta
                        rooftops,
                        the
                        whitewashed
                        walls and on the horizon, the soft blue sea.</p>
